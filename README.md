# SHA256

The working of the SHA-256 is written in this repository. This has been done in two ways 
       1. Without using built-in packages
       2. By using the SHA256 package

* SHA-256, which stands for secure hash algorithm 256, is a cryptographic hashing algorithm (or function) that’s used for message, file, and data integrity verification. 


* It’s part of the SHA-2 family of hash functions and uses a 256-bit key to take a piece of data and convert it into a new, unrecognizable data string of a fixed length. 

* This string of random characters and numbers, called a hash value, is also 256 bits in size.

* Secure hash algorithms (SHA) were designed by the National Security Agency (NSA). The U.S. government patented the algorithm, then released it under a royalty-free license so anybody could use it for free. 

* Hashing algorithms are used as one-way functions, meaning that they’re designed to be processed one way but are too cumbersome to reverse engineer.

* The SHA-0 algorithm came first in 1993. SHA-1 followed in 1995, and, although it has been cracked, SHA-1 is still in use today. 


* The SHA-2 family, of which SHA 256 is a member, was released in 2001 and includes six hash functions:

      SHA 224
      SHA 256
      SHA 384
      SHA 512
      SHA 512/224
      SHA 512/256
